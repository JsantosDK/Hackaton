            Carla came for a one-time cleaning. We gave her a few hours to
            herself and came back to the house looking spotless. Her attention
            to detail is amazing - bathtub scrubbed, refrigerator shelves clean,
            shelves neatly arranged (but nothing out of place), dust removed all
            around.

            The cleaning itself was very, very thorough. We hired her for
            move-out cleaning of our one-bedroom apartment in Lisbon and she did
            a great job. I wish we hired her when we moved in, as the place is
            pretty old. However, scheduling a time was quite stressful. Texting
            the available number is probably your best bet over calling or
            messaging via WhatsApp. The management kept rescheduling on me. When
            it rolled around to our set time and day, I asked if she was almost
            at my place, and she said there was an emergency and that I would
            need to reschedule. I understand that things come up for people, but
            she should've notified me proactively instead of me asking 15
            minutes past my set appointment time. Also, when I scheduled my
            appointment, I sent them pictures of my place to get a quote, and
            they said it'd be one price, and the two ladies ended up charging me
            another price that was higher, weird considering I already
            pre-cleaned a bit. Overall, she did a really great job at cleaning
            itself. But if you're on a strict timeline (like moveout) or on a
            strict budget, probably not worth it.
