                        I needed urgent exterior window washing for my 3 story townhome as we had tenants moving in, and had to have it done in 2 days. 
                        I called around and no one could get me in soon. I was able to reach Filipe who happened to be in the area and happened to be available. 
                        He got to my house in less than an hour and had the job done in a few hours. He was prompt and professional and texted me photos afterwards 
                        since I couldn't be there in person. I was able to submit payment electronically and all was done with ease. For what could have been a 
                        stressful situation was stress-free. Thanks, Filipe!!!

                    The cleaning itself was very, very thorough. We hired her for
                    move-out cleaning of our one-bedroom apartment in Lisbon and she did
                    a great job. I wish we hired her when we moved in, as the place is
                    pretty old. However, scheduling a time was quite stressful. Texting
                    the available number is probably your best bet over calling or
                    messaging via WhatsApp. The management kept rescheduling on me. When
                    it rolled around to our set time and day, I asked if she was almost
                    at my place, and she said there was an emergency and that I would
                    need to reschedule. I understand that things come up for people, but
                    she should've notified me proactively instead of me asking 15
                    minutes past my set appointment time. Also, when I scheduled my
                    appointment, I sent them pictures of my place to get a quote, and
                    they said it'd be one price, and the two ladies ended up charging me
                    another price that was higher, weird considering I already
                    pre-cleaned a bit. Overall, she did a really great job at cleaning
                    itself. But if you're on a strict timeline (like moveout) or on a
                    strict budget, probably not worth it.
